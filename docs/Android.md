# Android app

A minimal Jetpack Compose wrapper around the same core the CLI runs. Type the
flags you would pass to `tg-ws-proxy`, tap **Start**, and when the `tg://proxy`
link appears tap it (or let the app open it) to add the proxy in Telegram.

The listen address should be `127.0.0.1` so Telegram on the same phone can
connect.

Add `--secret <32 hex chars>` if you want the link to stay the same across
restarts. `--log-file` is ignored; logs go to the on-screen view and logcat
(`tg-ws-proxy`).

The default arguments carry `--quiet`, so the on-screen **Log** panel stays
empty until you remove it. That is the default and not a failed start: drop
`--quiet` (or swap it for `--verbose`) before tapping **Start** to see log
lines. The `tg://` link appears either way — it reaches the UI from the listen
callback rather than by scraping the log, so `--quiet` never hides it.

## Requirements

- JDK 17+ already on `PATH`. The Gradle wrapper downloads *Gradle*, not a JDK:
  there is no toolchain block and no foojay resolver in this build, so a missing
  or older JDK fails the build instead of provisioning one.
- Android SDK at `ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, or `~/Android/Sdk`
  (compile SDK 37)
- The Android NDK version pinned in `android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`
  (currently `28.1.13356709`) under `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/`, or set
  `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` / `ANDROID_NDK` to an explicit NDK directory
- Rust with `rustup` and `cargo` on `PATH`
- To run it: a device or emulator on Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer. That is the
  app's `minSdk`, set from `android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`, and it is a hard
  floor — the released APKs refuse to install below it.

Gradle installs the required Rust targets with `rustup target add` as part of
its native build task. Unless `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` or `ANDROID_NDK` is set, it
uses exactly the NDK version pinned in the version catalog and fails with the
required `sdkmanager --install` command when that version is absent.

The app's `versionName` and base `versionCode` come from `Cargo.toml`, the
repo's single source of truth (CI enforces a version bump on every PR). Update
`package.version` and `package.metadata.android.version_code` together. The
base code must be `(MAJOR*10000 + MINOR*100 + PATCH)*10`; the
`tgwsproxy.android` convention plugin validates that relationship and adds the
per-ABI offset: `0` for universal, `1` for armeabi-v7a, `2` for arm64-v8a, and
`3` for x86_64.

Plugin, SDK and AndroidX versions live in `android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
The Cargo NDK task, version mapping and release signing live under
`android/build-logic/` so `android/app/build.gradle.kts` stays the module identity
and dependencies.

## Build

From the repository root on Linux/macOS:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

From Windows PowerShell or `cmd.exe`:

```bat
cd android
gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

The Gradle `:app:cargoNdk` task cross-compiles `libtg_ws_proxy_jni.so` first and
puts generated libraries under `android/app/build/generated/rustJniLibs`. The
debug APKs land in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`: one per ABI
(`app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk`, `app-armeabi-v7a-debug.apk`, `app-x86_64-debug.apk`)
plus `app-universal-debug.apk`, which carries every ABI at roughly three times
the size. `output-metadata.json` in the same directory lists what was written.

The embedded native library is built in release mode even for a debug APK. A
debug `.so` is roughly 90 MB per ABI and too slow for normal proxy use. Override
with `TG_ANDROID_RUST_PROFILE=debug` if you need native debug symbols.

`TG_ANDROID_API` (default 26) selects the NDK clang wrapper the cross-compile
runs — `aarch64-linux-android<API>-clang` and its siblings — and so is the API
level the native library itself is built against. The convention plugin reads
it; it is *not* wired to `minSdk`, which lives in
`android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Raise the two together or not at all: a
`.so` built against a newer API can bind symbols that the older devices
`minSdk` still admits do not have, and that failure only appears on the device.

Build only the native libraries:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :app:cargoNdk
```

Release (R8-minified and resource-shrunk, so `NativeProxy`'s keep rule in
`proguard-rules.pro` is exercised; unsigned unless you add a signing config —
see below):

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

The outputs are the same per-ABI plus universal set under
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`, named `app-<abi>-release-unsigned.apk`
unless a keystore is configured and `app-<abi>-release.apk` when one is.

## Signing a release

A release APK is only signed when a keystore is configured. Put the path and
secrets in `android/keystore.properties` (gitignored, never commit it):

```properties
storeFile=/home/user/keystore.jks
storePassword=change-me
keyAlias=tgwsproxy
keyPassword=change-me
```

The same values can be passed as the environment variables
`TG_ANDROID_STORE_FILE`, `TG_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD`, `TG_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
and `TG_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`, which is how a deploy pipeline signs without
checking in a properties file. A value set in `keystore.properties` wins over
the matching environment variable; with neither, `assembleRelease` produces an
unsigned APK as before. With one configured the outputs are the same per-ABI
plus universal set, written as `app-<abi>-release.apk` — the `-unsigned` suffix
AGP appends is simply gone. There has been no single `app-release.apk` since
the ABI splits landed.

Generate a keystore once and keep it backed up. Android identifies an installed
app by its package name *and* its signing key, and it accepts an update only
when the key matches, so replacing the key later means every existing install
has to be removed and reinstalled — taking its saved arguments with it. (The
`tg://proxy` link has no part in this: it carries a host, a port and a secret,
and nothing about the app that printed it.)

## Deploy

Use the Android Gradle Plugin install tasks instead of a separate deploy script.
With one device or emulator connected:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat` with the same task names. `installRelease` is
registered only when a keystore is configured (unsigned release APKs cannot
be installed).

Limit native and packaged ABIs with `TG_ANDROID_ABIS`; names may be separated by
spaces or commas:

```sh
cd android
TG_ANDROID_ABIS=arm64-v8a ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
TG_ANDROID_ABIS=arm64-v8a,x86_64 ./gradlew :app:cargoNdk
```

The supported ABI names are `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, and `x86`.
The APK default remains `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `x86_64`. The split set
follows the same list, so `TG_ANDROID_ABIS=arm64-v8a` yields exactly
`app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk` and a universal APK holding only that one ABI.

## CI

Two jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` cover the app, on every pull request and
on pushes to `main` and to release tags.

**`android` — it builds.** Assembles both the debug and the release APKs
(release additionally runs R8, which is what exercises `NativeProxy`'s keep rule
in `proguard-rules.pro`), uploads them as build artifacts, and runs the Gradle
wrapper JAR checksum validation via `gradle/actions/setup-gradle`. Two shape
checks follow the build, because both things they look for fail silently:

- *the split APK set* — a `splits` block that stopped applying still yields one
  perfectly valid fat APK, and a split for an ABI that was never cross-compiled
  still yields a perfectly valid APK with an empty `lib/`. The job asserts the
  four expected outputs exist and that each carries exactly the
  `libtg_ws_proxy_jni.so` set its name claims. Keep its ABI list in sync with
  `AndroidAbi.defaultAbis`.
- *the packaged JNI symbols* — a JNI entry point binds by name at the first
  call, not at link time, so the Kotlin package and the hand-written `Java_…`
  symbols in `crates/android-jni/src/android.rs` are a contract nothing in the
  build enforces. The job derives the mangled names from `android.namespace`,
  checks them against the shipped `.so`'s `.dynsym`, and checks
  `NATIVE_CLASS_NAME` and the four R8-kept callbacks against the packaged dex.

**`android-emulator` — it runs.** A matrix over API 26 (the `minSdk` floor, and
the only level that takes `ProxyService`'s pre-O notification-channel and
pre-34 foreground-service-type branches) and API 36 (`targetSdk`: `specialUse`
foreground-service enforcement and the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` path). It pins
`TG_ANDROID_ABIS=x86_64` at job level and runs the connected suite through
`.github/scripts/run-connected-tests.sh` — a script file rather than inline
`script:` lines, because the emulator action wraps each line in its own
`sh -c`. The suite is `android/app/src/androidTest/`: the JNI contract tests and
the `nativeStop()` ANR regression.

Both jobs pin the NDK because the hosted runner images swap their installed NDK
without notice. The pin has one source of truth: the `ndk` entry in
`android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`. CI, release builds, the convention plugin,
and the F-Droid recipe all read that value, so bumping the NDK means editing
that one line.

The Rust toolchain comes from `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`, and `Swatinem/rust-cache`
keeps the Android cross-compile outputs across runs, under a separate key per
job so the two ABI sets cannot evict each other.

The `android` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` attaches the whole APK set
to every release, named `tg-ws-proxy-rs-android-<version>-<abi>.apk` — the
`-android-` is there because the OpenWrt LuCI packages on the same release page
are also called `.apk`. It runs beside `upload-assets` rather than after it, and
`publish-release` waits on it, so a failed APK build leaves the release a draft
instead of publishing one without an APK.

Signing is optional and off by default. With none of the secrets below set, the
job still succeeds and uploads
`tg-ws-proxy-rs-android-<version>-<abi>-unsigned.apk`, which Android will not
install without `adb install` and a manual signature — that is the current state
of this repository. To ship signed APKs, create four repository secrets:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `TG_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | the keystore itself, base64-encoded: `base64 -w0 keystore.jks` on Linux, `base64 -i keystore.jks` on macOS |
| `TG_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD` | `storePassword` |
| `TG_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | `keyAlias` |
| `TG_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | `keyPassword` |

`TG_ANDROID_STORE_FILE` is deliberately not a secret: it is a path, and the
workflow computes it when it decodes the keystore into the runner's temporary
directory (mode 600, deleted when the job ends).

## What the core change is

`src/server.rs` is the accept loop that used to live only in `main.rs`. The
Android JNI module is its own crate, `crates/android-jni` (compiled only for
`target_os = "android"`), which parses the text field with
`Config::try_from_cli_line` and runs that loop on a background Tokio runtime.
Stop completes a watch channel, which breaks the accept loop.

It is a separate crate and not a `cdylib` on the root library because
`crate-type` is a per-package setting: with the shim in the root crate every
desktop and Docker `cargo build` also linked an `.so` nobody loads. The
workspace's `default-members` is the root package alone, so `cargo
build`/`test`/`clippy` at the repository root never touch it; `:app:cargoNdk`
selects it with `cargo build -p tg-ws-proxy-jni --lib`.

The proxy keeps running in a foreground service so Android does not kill it
when you switch to Telegram.
